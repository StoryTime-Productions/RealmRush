## Description

RealmRush is a 3D game developed using the Unity Engine to explore the application of advanced data structures and code practices to develop intermediate enemy AI. 

## Features

- Placeable turret/tower defenses to defend your base from enemy ram vehicles.
- Fully working splash, main menu, pause menu and game over menu.
- UI text with a custom font detailing current balance and number of enemies killed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Unity Game Engine (Unity Editor).

The game is solely meant for learning purposes and is not planned to be released to major platforms, unless significant and unique features are implemented.

## How to Play

- Use the left-mouse-button (LMB) to place turrets/towers that shoot projectiles to defend your base.
- Use the escape key to pause the game, to either resume, restart or quit the game.
- An additional, more dynamic and harder gamemode is currently undergoing development.
